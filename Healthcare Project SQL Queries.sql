---- Data Cleaning

--- a. Checking for Duplicates

--- Standardize Categorical Data

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;


-- Gender: Should be "Male" or "Female"
UPDATE healthcare

-- Medical Condition: Standardize capitalization.
UPDATE healthcare

--- Handle Missing Values
-- a. Check for NULLs
SELECT *

-- b. Decide how to handle them (e.g., remove rows, impute values). For now, letâ€™s flag them
